# Dominion

This game was made for a GameJam in my local ACM chapter, and as such is not thoroughly refined. Known bugs include: Text not wrapping/getting cut off, The turns being off sometimes during repeated two player games, and a small problem where the easy and hard buttons from the one-player mode remain on the screen if you click on the How to Play button. However, this game does function correctly overall. Enjoy!
